    Privacy Policy

	  Whinny Inc. (“Whinny”, “us”, “we”, or “our”) provides users with messaging and other services. At Whinny, your privacy is very important to us. We highly value and respect our users and understand the information that you enter into our application (“app”) and or website (“site”) needs to be protected. Therefore, we will only use your information for the purposes and means described in this privacy policy.

    Collecting user information
    By downloading the Whinny app and registering an account, you are sharing information with us like your name, email address, and telephone number. Providing this information is completely at the user’s discretion. However, choosing to not provide the information requested may mean that some or all of our services will not be available to you.  If you have chosen to opt out of marketing messages from us, there may still be instances where we will need to contact you by phone or email regarding your account.

    Some information might be collected from the user automatically. This includes, but is not limited to, the IP address of your device, unique device ID, mobile operating system, type of mobile device you use, as well as information regarding the way in which you use the app.

    How we use your information
    The contact information that you choose to provide may be used for marketing and analytical reasons. Examples include:
    To confirm your registration or subscription
    Respond to user’s questions and or comments pertaining to our services
    To keep you in the loop regarding upcoming updates, services, or offers
    To analyze the app and website user statistics and preferences
    Long story short, we want to make your user experience as good as possible! We are always seeking to improve.

    User information may be shared if required by law or in order to protect our rights or our users’ safety. It is possible that we might create a business relationship with a third-party. A user’s information might be rented, exchanged, or shared with the third-party. This includes both anonymous data such as age and gender as well as contact information that would allow a third-party to contact you with information regarding services or products that may interest you. The third-party would of course be Whinny approved and will need to have a privacy policy that matches ours. If you would rather keep your information to yourself there will always be an opt-out option, such as unsubscribing to information and deleting the app from your device. If you are absolutely against us sharing your information with third parties, email us at privacy@whinny.com.




    Opting out of information
    We will work very hard to ensure that whatever information we send to you in the form of email or messaging will be informative, entertaining, or worthwhile. However, we understand that not all computers have “horse information only” filters and email inboxes can start overflowing. While we hope to keep the communication lines open, this is entirely your choice.  You may choose to opt out of receiving marketing communication messages at any time by unsubscribing through the link provided in emails/messages received or by emailing your request to opt-out to privacy@whinny.com.

    Cookies
    We use something called cookies on our website- no not the edible variety that our equine friends enjoy- rather a small text file with an ID tag. Cookies are created when you use your internet browser to visit a website that uses cookies. Cookies are used for things like helping you to log in to our website and compiling aggregate data to track website use in order to better serve our users in the future. You have the option to disable cookies through your web browser settings. However, doing so may interfere with your ability to use our site.

    Security
    Because we care about our users, we have implemented security measures to protect user information that has been provided to us against misuse, alteration, and loss. We use secure server software (SSL), and encrypt all user information before it is sent to us. All user messages used through the Whinny app are encrypted. Unfortunately, there is the possibility that some part of our security implementations could fail due to unforeseen circumstances. If this occurs, Whinny will not be responsible for any actual or consequential damages that may result in a breach in privacy policy due to a security or technical malfunction. Know that we take security very seriously and do our absolute best to protect our users’ information.

    Age
    Users must be at least 13 years old to use our services. We do not knowingly collect information or send email communications to anyone under the age of 13.

    Links to outside websites
    Our app and website may contain links to websites that are operated by third parties and are out of our control. Those third-party websites may have a privacy policy that is different than ours. Accessing linked third-party websites is at your own risk.

    Changes in policy
    If our privacy policy changes at any time, we will inform you by posting a notice on our website. All changes will be noted and brought to your attention within the privacy policy itself.

    Contact us
    If you have any questions or concerns while using our app or website regarding this privacy policy, please contact us at privacy@whinny.com.
